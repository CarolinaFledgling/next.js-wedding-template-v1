## Next.js, MongoDB, MUI, FORMIK, YUP Project

### Digital Wedding Invitations (Paperless Wedding Invitations)

Project consist of Wedding Landing Page with smart and powerful Form which collect all necessary data (based on requirements ) and display collected data on **summary** page in a clear way.

**summary page** will be protected by password only the invitation owner will be able to check the results collected from the Form and download the PDF file.


## Status

**Work-in-Progress**

- My own idea for a full-stack project which I improve daily
- I'm refactoring it, should be deployed in near future

## In the coming days I am planing : 

- refactoring code. Make reused function ( In summary file, repeat filters too many times.)
- make it more UX friendly
- create PDF document with collected date
- refactoring, make reuseable components etc.
- work on RWD and more 
- summary page will be protected by password

## Digital Wedding Invitations (Paperless Wedding Invitations)

My project is called Digital Wedding Invitation, a full-stack application designed to help couples plan and organize their special day. Built with Next.js and MongoDB. It includes a powerful form that collects all the necessary information based on their specific requirements, such as  number of guests, any special requests or preferences.

Landing page is smart and intuitive, making it easy for couples to provide all the necessary information.

Once the form is completed, the collected information is displayed in a dashboard on a separate URL. This allows couples to review, as well as keep track of any changes or updates. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for couples to navigate and manage their wedding details.

I plan to add many more features that will solve problems with sending paper invitations, such as a budget tracker and guest list manager.

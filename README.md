### Digital Wedding Invitations (Paperless Wedding Invitations)



Project consist of Wedding Landing Page with smart and powerful Form which collect all necessary data (based on requirements ) and display collected data on **summary** page in a clear way.

**summary page** will be protected by password only the invitation owner will be able to check the results collected from the Form and download the PDF file.


## DEMO Link

[Landing Page](https://ditialweddinginivitation.netlify.app/)
- The most important on this page will be the form that will allow you to collect the most important date (based on requirements)
- Test the form by sending fake data and see how it works

[Summary page ](https://ditialweddinginivitation.netlify.app/summary)
- Check the results collected from the Form
- It will be protected by password only the invitation owner will be able to check the results
- There will be a button that allows you to download a PDF file with the collected data.
- I plan add many more features that will solve problems with sending paper invitations. 

### Landing Page


The landing page provide basic information about the event. (In the future , I am planning to connect the landing page with Sanity CMS. The owner will be able to add / and change the content of the landing page. 

## Status

**Work-in-Progress**

- My own idea for a full-stack project which I improve daily
- I'm refactoring it

## In the coming days I am planing : 

- refactoring code. Make reused function ( In summary file, repeat filters too many times.)
- make it more UX friendly
- create PDF document with collected date
- refactoring, make reuseable components etc.
- work on RWD and more 
- summary page will be protected by password
